# NLP-Projects

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Portfolio This repository showcases my NLP projects, demonstrating my skills in text analysis, machine learning, and language understanding. The projects cover a range of topics, including: 

1.Text classification (sentiment analysis, spam detection)

2.Language modeling (text generation, language translation)

3.Information extraction (named entity recognition, topic modeling)

## Each project includes:

1.A brief description of the problem and approach

2.Code in Python, using popular libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn

3.Results, including visualizations and insights

## My goal is to share my work, provide context, and demonstrate my ability to:

1.Preprocess and analyze text data

2.Develop predictive models for text classification and language understanding

3.Extract insights and meaning from text data 

I hope you find my NLP portfolio informative and inspiring! Explore the projects to see my approach and results.
